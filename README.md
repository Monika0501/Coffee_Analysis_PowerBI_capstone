# Coffee_Analysis_PowerBI_capstone

This project analyzes data from the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) to identify key factors that influence coffee quality using sensory attributes like Aroma, Flavor, Aftertaste, and more.

## :bar_chart: Project Overview

Goal: To understand and visualize the impact of various attributes on overall coffee quality.
Dataset: Provided by CQI (Coffee Quality Institute)
Tools Used: Power BI, Excel, Data Cleaning with Power Query

## 📌 Key Insights
Attributes like Aroma, Flavor, Acidity, Aftertaste, Balance significantly influence coffee quality.
Top coffee varieties: Castillo, Redbourbon
Top regions: Ethiopia, Tanzania, Guatemala
Top processing methods: Double Anaerobic Washed, Semi Washed, Honey-Mosto
Higher altitude regions tend to produce fewer defective beans

## ⚙️ Data Cleaning & Modelling
Cleaned and transformed multiple columns (e.g., Altitude, Bag Weight, Grading Date)
Created relationships between tables for sensory analysis
Built interactive dashboards and visualizations

## 📈 Visualizations
Sensory Attributes vs Total Cup Points
Defects Trends by Country and Processing Method
Correlation between Attributes and Quality Scores

## 🗂 Files Included
** Ppt_powerbi_CoffeeQualityAnalysis.pptx: Presentation of the full analysis
** README.md: This file

## 🧠Conclusion
The combination of bean variety, origin, and processing methods is critical in producing high-quality coffee.
