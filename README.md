# Coffee_Analysis_PowerBI_capstone

This project analyzes data from the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) to identify key factors that influence coffee quality using sensory attributes like Aroma, Flavor, Aftertaste, and more.

## Project Overview

Goal: To understand and visualize the impact of various attributes on overall coffee quality.
Dataset: Provided by CQI (Coffee Quality Institute)
Tools Used: Power BI, Excel, Data Cleaning with Power Query

## Key Insights
Attributes like Aroma, Flavor, Acidity, Aftertaste, Balance significantly influence coffee quality.
Top coffee varieties: Castillo, Redbourbon
Top regions: Ethiopia, Tanzania, Guatemala
Top processing methods: Double Anaerobic Washed, Semi Washed, Honey-Mosto
Higher altitude regions tend to produce fewer defective beans

Data Cleaning & Modelling
Cleaned and transformed multiple columns (e.g., Altitude, Bag Weight, Grading Date)
Created relationships between tables for sensory analysis
Built interactive dashboards and visualizations

Visualizations
Sensory Attributes vs Total Cup Points
Defects Trends by Country and Processing Method
Correlation between Attributes and Quality Scores
